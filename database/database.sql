Those columns are centered in the page with the parent .container.\r\n\r\nBreaking it down, here‚Äôs how it works:\r\n\r\nContainers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site‚Äôs contents. Use .container for a responsive pixel width or .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.\r\nRows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.\r\nIn a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.\r\nThanks to flexbox, grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. For example, four instances of .col-sm will each automatically be 25% wide from the small breakpoint and up. See the auto-layout columns section for more examples.\r\nColumn classes indicate the number of columns you‚Äôd like to use out of the possible 12 per row. So, if you want three equal-width columns across, you can use .col-4.\r\nColumn widths are set in percentages, so they‚Äôre always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.\r\nColumns have horizontal padding to create the gutters between individual columns, however, you can remove the margin from rows and padding from columns with .no-gutters on the .row.\r\nTo make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.\r\nGrid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning they apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint).\r\nYou can use predefined grid classes (like .col-4) or Sass mixins for more semantic markup.\r\nBe aware of the limitations and bugs around flexbox, like the inability to use some HTML elements as flex containers.The above example creates three equal-width columns on small, medium, large, and extra large devices using our predefined grid classes.
